with credit to the person who made the original script @ https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyMods/comments/71b958/i_have_created_a_method_of_ship_seed_mining/

I have tweaked it .

i understand the pictures aren't as pretty when not using photomode but this way you get to see the seed in the image so its easier to share/etc.

the scripts for each type are in the relevant folder(s) root(s)

instructions:

1. start with game already loaded -> go to the ingventory menu and go to the appropriate thing you want screenshots of then hit tab
2. load up the NMS Editor Jar file and leave it on the first tab
3. run the AHK script by loading it and hitting F3.   F2 will reload the script and F1 will end ti

4.  also you may want to edit the script a bit if your game path isnt F:\SHTEEM\
